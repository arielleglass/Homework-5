# Homework-5
This homework analyzes and visualizes monthly homicides in Baltimore, MD. 

Description of coding workflow: 
First, I filtered the city homicide data for the city of Baltimore. I grouped the homicide counts by year and month and then categorized by seasons. I used a bar plot to show the monthly homicides stacked by seasons with a smooth trend line and vertical dashed line to mark the arrest of Freddie Gray on April 12, 2015.

Graph results: 
There are no statistics in this graph so it's hard to determine which years and seasons have a higher number of homicides in Baltimore. The graph indicates that some months and years have have a higher number of homicides than others and that they seem to increase after the murder of Freddie Gray.
